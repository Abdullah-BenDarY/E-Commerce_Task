* Kotlin coroutines to handle requests
* Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert  meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.
* Hilt injection
* MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

* view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
